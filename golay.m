%        In many applications one is measuring a variable that is both 
%        slowly varying and corrupted by random noise. Then it is often 
%        desirable to apply a smoothing filter to the measured data in 
%        order to reconstruct the underlying smooth function. We assume 
%        that the noise is independent of the observed variable and that 
%        the noise obeys a normal distribution with zero mean and given 
%        variation.
